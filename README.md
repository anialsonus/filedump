# Greenplum Database Filedump 

Greenplum Database Filedump is a utility to format Greenplum heap/index/control files into a human-readable form. You can format/dump the files several ways, as listed in the Invocation section, as well as dumping straight binary. 

This project is based on [PostgreSQL Filedump](https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=pg_filedump.git;a=summary), with modification for support of Greenplum Database. Refer to the [PostgreSQL Filedump wiki](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Pg_filedump) for more information. 

The original readme of PostgreSQL Filedump is included as [README.pg_filedump](README.pg_filedump)
